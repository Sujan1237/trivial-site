    <p>Paras Khadka is my Nepali favorite cricketer of all time. Paras khadka, the name itself is a emotion of
        many nepali fans like me. He is considered as the best batsman and a captain that nepal cricket has ever
        produced. He made his debut in 2006 and taken the captaincy of nepal’s cricket in 2009. He is the longest
        serving and the most successful captain of nepal. Under his captaincy nepal won ICC world cricket division
        league 5, 4 and 3. Nepal also participated in ICC cricket t-20 world cup and gained both t-20 status and
        ODI status under his captaincy. He has been the most dependable or say a backbone of nepal batting order,
        winning so many games for the nation. He is also a first nepal batsman and a captain to score both ODI’s
        and t-20i century. After captaining a side for more than a decade he stepped down from his captaincy in
        2019 but still playing. He is one of the most loved and respected personality of nepal as he has been a
        true servant of Nepal’s cricket for so many years. He has brought so many glory to the nation and his
        contributions to nepal cricket and the country is immeasurable and will never be forgotten.</p>
